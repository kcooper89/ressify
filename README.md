# Welcome to React Cars!

React Cars is an application that allows you to track your car buying journey.  This website will also provide you with video information regarding different avenues of car purchasing and what may be best for you. When you revisit the application in the future and log in you will be able to see the list of cars that you are interested in.  

The main feature of our app is the Car Tracker, with which you can enter information about a vehicle that you have looked at and save it for future reference. You can edit the post if anything changes with the vehicle. If the car sells, you can delete it. 

* Created using MERN stack: MongoDB, Express, React, & Node.js
