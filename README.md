# Welcome to React Cars!

React Cars is an application that allows you to track your car buying journey. You can enter information about a vehicle that you have looked at and save it for future reference. You can also delete it if the car sells. This website will also provide you with video information regarding different avenues of car purchasing and what may be best for you. When you revisit the application in the future and log in you will be able to see the list of cars that you are interested in.  

* Created using MERN stack: MongoDB, Express, React, & Node.js
* CRUD functionality
* Bootstrap mobile optimized: Responsive
* Firebase: Login purposes
* Mongoose: Data storage
* Axios : Promise based HTTP client for the browser and node.js
